# Fyle-project

For the initial phase of the project, I selected a GitHub user's repository, specifically "rhysd." Utilizing XmlHttpRequest, I orchestrated an API request to obtain detailed information about the repositories via the following endpoint: https://api.github.com/users/rhysd/repos.

During the development process, I employed Postman to meticulously examine the API data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the content to be displayed on the screen. Noteworthy is the observation that certain repositories may lack description or language information. Additionally, the actual number of repositories retrieved from the API may vary, potentially being fewer than the predetermined count.

An integral feature of the project is its adaptability. Users can seamlessly customize their experience by changing the username associated with the GitHub API. This flexibility allows the utilization of any valid GitHub username, expanding the versatility of the application.

I welcome any further inquiries or clarifications and appreciate your time and consideration.

Thank you.
